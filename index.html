    <h1>Connect Four</h1>

    <p>INSTRUCTIONS: 2 players (blue and red) alternate turns. On each turn, a player drops a game piece corresponding to their player color in the top of a selected column. This piece will fall down to the furthest-down unoccupied cell.</p>
    <p>The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game ends in a tie if the entire board is filled up without a winner.</p>
